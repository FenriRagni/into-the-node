## Learning Points
Througout this project, I got a better understanding of how to use node, inquirer, and how to parse my own libraries for use in js files.

I also learned how to insert template literals into strings for a much easier and cleaner experience

## Credits
Thanks to [Ezekiel](github.com/ezekiel186) for helping me understand some of the concepts better by talking through the asks!
